**CarMusicAutoPause**


App for Android car Head Unit (HU), such as Teyes,
without DSP, devices to pause music when audio is muted and resume it when the volume is > 0.
Logic taken from the german car multimedia systems and ported to Android HU. Can be used on Android phones, tablets, TVs.
**Issue**
Does not work with HU with DSP, as volume in this HU is not regulated directly, but using custom Android Framework.
